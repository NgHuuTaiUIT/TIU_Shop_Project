      "Men should play around with shirting, styling the look formally or giving it a more relaxed feel, depending on the shirt. It’s all about creating a more relaxed feel, compared to wearing a three-piece suit. But, at the same time ensure the outfit still has a certain formality to it.

      "Try wearing it with a t-shirt, short sleeve shirt or a long sleeve shirt with the sleeves rolled up.",

When borrowing from the boys’ department, the largest tuxedo shirt serves as a style statement too.
